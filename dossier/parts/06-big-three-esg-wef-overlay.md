Big Three, ESG, and WEF’s governance overlay

6.1 ESG and net-zero alliances
	•	Vanguard:
	•	Withdrew from NZAM in 2022, citing focus on mandate and legal constraints.
	•	Climate Action 100+:
	•	Announced that JPMorgan Asset Management and State Street Global Advisors left the coalition, while BlackRock shifted participation to a non-U.S. entity.
	•	NZAM after the exits:
	•	Vanguard’s exit and later BlackRock changes contributed to a pause and relaunch planning with a softened commitment, but the basic net-zero ideology persists.

So globally, ESG and net-zero coordination is still powerful. In the U.S., legal and political pushback is forcing big managers to soften, compartmentalize, or partly retreat from the most aggressive climate-cartel posture.

6.2 WEF leadership
	•	After internal turmoil and scrutiny of Klaus Schwab’s governance, WEF installed Larry Fink and André Hoffmann as interim co-chairs of the board.
	•	WEF continues to promote:
	•	Climate and net-zero,
	•	DEI and “Global Parity,”
	•	“Stakeholder capitalism,”
	•	Public-private governance frameworks.

Big Three provide:
	•	Capital and corporate leverage that is consistent with WEF’s trajectory, even as they hedge under U.S. legal threat.
	•	Leadership presence (Fink) inside WEF’s core.

(Carney, as above, is the Canadian political face of this ESG and climate-finance world.)
