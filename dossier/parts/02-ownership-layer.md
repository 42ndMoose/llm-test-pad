The “Big Three” asset managers are:
	•	BlackRock
	•	Vanguard
	•	State Street

[CLAIM]
BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street are commonly referred to as the “Big Three” U.S. asset managers in the context of index-fund and institutional ownership concentration.
Evidence:
- https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3126067
[/CLAIM]

They run massive index funds and own large pieces of almost every major U.S. public company, including the parents of major news outlets.

[CLAIM]
Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street frequently appear among the largest institutional holders across many S&P 500 companies due to broad index-fund ownership and related institutional positions.
Verification paths:
- SEC EDGAR 13F filings (search by manager name + form “13F-HR”): https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/

2.2 The zoomed-out pattern

Across the S&P 500:
	•	Vanguard and BlackRock are among the top few institutional shareholders in a huge majority of companies, State Street often joins them.
	•	In media, you repeatedly see the same trio on the cap table:
	•	Comcast (NBC/MSNBC),
	•	Disney (ABC),
	•	Warner Bros. Discovery (CNN),
	•	Fox Corp / News Corp (Fox News, WSJ),
	•	Sinclair and others.

[CLAIM]
Across major U.S. public companies (including major media parents), Vanguard and BlackRock often appear among top institutional holders, with State Street frequently also near the top (verify with SEC proxy statements for issuer-level “beneficial owner” disclosures + SEC EDGAR 13F filings for manager-level holdings).
Verification paths:
- SEC issuer proxy statements (DEF 14A) per ticker (EDGAR browse links above)
- SEC EDGAR 13F filings (manager-level; search by manager name + “13F-HR”): https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/
- Research context (“Giant Three” / common ownership discussion): https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3126067
[/CLAIM]

Key point:
	•	The Big Three do not own everything, and they cannot override dual-class insiders like the Murdochs.
	•	But they are anchor tenants in the ownership stack of most major media conglomerates.

[CLAIM]
Dual-class share structures can let insiders retain voting control even when large institutional investors hold significant economic ownership (verify with proxy statements / governance disclosures; then compare to a general governance explainer if you want).
