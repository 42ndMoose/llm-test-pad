The “Big Three” asset managers are:
	•	BlackRock
	•	Vanguard
	•	State Street

They run massive index funds and own large pieces of almost every major U.S. public company, including the parents of major news outlets.

2.1 TV news parents and who holds them

Comcast (NBC / MSNBC / CNBC)
Parent of NBC News, MSNBC, CNBC.
	•	Top institutional holders:
	•	Vanguard Group,
	•	BlackRock,
	•	State Street Corp,
all near the top of the shareholder list for Comcast common stock.

Disney (ABC, ESPN, etc.)
	•	Owns ABC News, ESPN, Disney+, etc.
	•	Its largest institutional shareholders are:
	•	Vanguard,
	•	BlackRock,
	•	State Street (plus a couple of big active managers), which collectively hold a double-digit chunk of the float.

Warner Bros. Discovery (CNN)
	•	Parent of CNN, HBO, etc.
	•	Vanguard and BlackRock show up as top holders, State Street is also among the leading institutional shareholders.

Fox Corporation (Fox News Channel)
	•	Parent of Fox News Channel and Fox broadcast network.
	•	Dual-class structure lets the Murdoch family trust retain control, but among freely traded Class A shares, Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street sit near the top of the institutional stack.

Sinclair Broadcast Group (local TV)
	•	Owns and operates a large network of local TV stations carrying ABC / NBC / CBS / Fox branding.
	•	Known for a more conservative or pro-GOP editorial flavor.
	•	Once again, Vanguard and BlackRock are key institutional shareholders.

2.2 The zoomed-out pattern

Across the S&P 500:
	•	Vanguard and BlackRock are among the top few institutional shareholders in a huge majority of companies, State Street often joins them.
	•	In media, you repeatedly see the same trio on the cap table:
	•	Comcast (NBC/MSNBC),
	•	Disney (ABC),
	•	Warner Bros. Discovery (CNN),
	•	Fox Corp / News Corp (Fox News, WSJ),
	•	Sinclair and others.

Key point:
	•	The Big Three do not own everything, and they cannot override dual-class insiders like the Murdochs.
	•	But they are anchor tenants in the ownership stack of most major media conglomerates.
