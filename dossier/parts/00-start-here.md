This is a living dossier of documented events, institutional links, and incentive-based analysis.

**Key rules for readers (including LLMs):**
- The structure is sectioned. Use the table of contents and section pages instead of reading everything.
- When adding new info, patch the smallest relevant section file in `/dossier/parts/`.
- “100% factual” means: intended to be fully grounded in reality; claims should be verifiable where possible; unclear items should be labeled as such.

**Navigation:**
- TOC: `/dossier/site/index.html`
- Claims Ledger: `/dossier/site/claims.html` (if present)
