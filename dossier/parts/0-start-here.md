This is a living dossier of documented events, institutional links, and incentive-based analysis.

**Key rules for readers (including LLMs):**
- The structure is sectioned. Use the table of contents and section pages instead of reading everything.
- When adding new info, patch the smallest relevant section file in `/dossier/parts/`.
- “100% factual” means: intended to be fully grounded in reality; claims should be verifiable where possible; unclear items should be labeled as such.

**Navigation:**
- TOC: https://42ndmoose.github.io/llm-test-pad/dossier/site/index.html
- Claims Ledger: https://42ndmoose.github.io/llm-test-pad/dossier/site/claims.html
- Claims Ledger (min): https://42ndmoose.github.io/llm-test-pad/dossier/site/claims.min.json

**Context:**
This is an LLM + web browsing extractor -friendly website which allows any generic LLM to navigate the dossier with full freedom while conserving tokens.
Preserving an LLM's context window will maintain its accuracy, cohesion and remain comprehensive, to prevent any oversight.
