<pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;line-height:1.35">
The “Big Three” asset managers are:
- BlackRock
- Vanguard
- State Street

They run massive index funds and hold large positions across a huge slice of U.S. public equities, including major media parents.



---

## 2.1 TV news parents and who holds them

### Comcast (NBC / MSNBC / CNBC)

Parent of NBC News, MSNBC, CNBC.


### Disney (ABC, ESPN, etc.)

Owns ABC News, ESPN, Disney+, etc.



### Warner Bros. Discovery (CNN)

Parent of CNN, HBO, etc.


### Fox Corporation (Fox News Channel)

Parent of Fox News Channel and Fox broadcast network.



### Sinclair Broadcast Group (local TV)

Owns and operates a large network of local TV stations carrying ABC / NBC / CBS / Fox branding.



---

## 2.2 The zoomed-out pattern

Across major U.S. public companies (including major media parents), Vanguard and BlackRock routinely show up as top institutional holders, with State Street frequently also near the top.


Key point:
- The Big Three do not “own everything,” and they cannot override dual-class insiders when insiders control votes.
- But they are often anchor tenants in the economic ownership layer across much of corporate America.
