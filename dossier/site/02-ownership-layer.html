The “Big Three” asset managers are:
	•	BlackRock
	•	Vanguard
	•	State Street

BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street are commonly referred to as the “Big Three” (or “Giant Three”) in the context of index-fund and institutional ownership concentration.

They run massive index funds and frequently appear among the largest institutional holders across many large U.S. public companies because broad index products must hold constituents at scale.

2.1 TV news parents and who holds them

Comcast (NBC / MSNBC / CNBC)
Parent of NBC News, MSNBC, CNBC.
	•	Top institutional holders commonly include:
	•	Vanguard Group
	•	BlackRock
	•	State Street Corp

For Comcast (CMCSA), you can verify major holders through its proxy “beneficial ownership” table and through SC 13G filings on SEC EDGAR.

Disney (ABC, ESPN, etc.)
	•	Owns ABC News, ESPN, Disney+, etc.
	•	Its largest institutional shareholders commonly include:
	•	Vanguard
	•	BlackRock
	•	State Street (plus other large managers)

For Disney (DIS), you can verify major holders through its proxy “beneficial ownership” table and through SC 13G filings on SEC EDGAR.

If you want a clean “combined %” number for Disney (Vanguard + BlackRock + State Street), compute it from the latest proxy beneficial owners table (and confirm with SC 13G filings if needed).

Warner Bros. Discovery (CNN)
	•	Parent of CNN, HBO, etc.
	•	Vanguard and BlackRock commonly show up as top holders, with State Street also often among leading institutions

For Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), you can verify major holders through its proxy beneficial ownership table and through SC 13G filings on SEC EDGAR.

Fox Corporation (Fox News Channel)
	•	Parent of Fox News Channel and Fox broadcast network.
	•	Dual-class structure lets the Murdoch family trust retain control, but large institutions can still hold a lot of economic ownership in the traded class.

Fox Corporation’s voting control structure can be verified in its proxy statement / annual filing disclosures on SEC EDGAR.

For Fox’s traded shares, large institutions (including Big Three firms) can be checked through Fox’s proxy beneficial owners table and through SC 13G filings on SEC EDGAR.

Sinclair Broadcast Group (local TV)
	•	Owns and operates a large network of local TV stations carrying ABC / NBC / CBS / Fox branding.
	•	Known for a more conservative or pro-GOP editorial flavor.
	•	Vanguard/BlackRock commonly show up as large holders, but voting control can be concentrated depending on class structure.

Sinclair’s ownership / voting control disclosures can be verified through its proxy statement on SEC EDGAR.

Sinclair major institutional holders can be checked via its proxy beneficial owners table and via SC 13G filings on SEC EDGAR.

2.2 The zoomed-out pattern

Across many large U.S. public companies (including major media parents), Vanguard and BlackRock often appear near the top of institutional holders, with State Street frequently also near the top.

Dual-class or controlled-company structures can let insiders retain voting control even when large institutional investors hold significant economic ownership.
