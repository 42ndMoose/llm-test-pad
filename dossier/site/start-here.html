2.	Ownership layer: Big Three and legacy media

The “Big Three” asset managers are:
	•	BlackRock
	•	Vanguard
	•	State Street

They run massive index funds and own large pieces of almost every major U.S. public company, including the parents of major news outlets.

2.1 TV news parents and who holds them

Comcast (NBC / MSNBC / CNBC)
Parent of NBC News, MSNBC, CNBC.
	•	Top institutional holders:
	•	Vanguard Group,
	•	BlackRock,
	•	State Street Corp,
all near the top of the shareholder list for Comcast common stock.

Disney (ABC, ESPN, etc.)
	•	Owns ABC News, ESPN, Disney+, etc.
	•	Its largest institutional shareholders are:
	•	Vanguard,
	•	BlackRock,
	•	State Street (plus a couple of big active managers), which collectively hold a double-digit chunk of the float.

Warner Bros. Discovery (CNN)
	•	Parent of CNN, HBO, etc.
	•	Vanguard and BlackRock show up as top holders, State Street is also among the leading institutional shareholders.

Fox Corporation (Fox News Channel)
	•	Parent of Fox News Channel and Fox broadcast network.
	•	Dual-class structure lets the Murdoch family trust retain control, but among freely traded Class A shares, Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street sit near the top of the institutional stack.

Sinclair Broadcast Group (local TV)
	•	Owns and operates a large network of local TV stations carrying ABC / NBC / CBS / Fox branding.
	•	Known for a more conservative or pro-GOP editorial flavor.
	•	Once again, Vanguard and BlackRock are key institutional shareholders.

2.2 The zoomed-out pattern

Across the S&amp;P 500:
	•	Vanguard and BlackRock are among the top few institutional shareholders in a huge majority of companies, State Street often joins them.
	•	In media, you repeatedly see the same trio on the cap table:
	•	Comcast (NBC/MSNBC),
	•	Disney (ABC),
	•	Warner Bros. Discovery (CNN),
	•	Fox Corp / News Corp (Fox News, WSJ),
	•	Sinclair and others.

Key point:
	•	The Big Three do not own everything, and they cannot override dual-class insiders like the Murdochs.
	•	But they are anchor tenants in the ownership stack of most major media conglomerates.

0.	Political context

	•	Donald Trump is serving again as president of the United States as the 45th and 47th president, back in office since January 20, 2025.
	•	His second term is focused heavily on:
	•	Rolling back DEI inside the federal state and its contractor ecosystem (Executive Order 14151, Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing, plus follow-on orders).
	•	Hitting ESG and climate-linked finance alliances (big U.S. managers pulling out of Net Zero Asset Managers and Climate Action 100+ under legal and political heat).
	•	Supercharging fossil fuels (national “energy emergency” framing and orders to accelerate approvals for fossil projects).
	•	Using tariffs as leverage to rewire trade and supply chains (new Trump tariffs and threats on Canada, Mexico, China, EU, framed explicitly as a negotiation tool).
	•	Pushing back against the post-2016 “mis/disinformation” and censorship network (DOJ antitrust statement of interest against viewpoint collusion, House “censorship-industrial complex” reports, attacks on fact-check cartels).

The rest of this doc is about who actually holds power, how that power is structured, and what Trump is realistically doing inside that structure.

0.1 On sources, platforms, and bias

Before walking into the weeds, it matters where information comes from.

Wikipedia
	•	Formally aims for neutrality, but on hot topics (Covid, Trump, populism, “misinformation,” ESG, gender, etc.) editorial disputes and admin power tend to push toward legacy-media consensus. The source lists on those pages are usually heavy with the same large outlets and NGOs we are talking about later.
	•	You can still use it for dates, names, and basic scaffolding. Treat it as a map of consensus plus bias, not a final authority.

Reddit (big subs) and Twitch
	•	Large subs and Twitch communities are shaped by:
	•	Platform policies (“hate,” “misinfo,” “harassment,” etc.).
	•	Mod teams who know what those policies are and what gets them in trouble.
	•	Users who push against dominant narratives on elections, vaccines, gender, immigration, etc. are more likely to be:
	•	Banned outright,
	•	Stealth-suppressed via rules about “harm,” “hate,” or “misinfo,”
	•	Dogpiled while mods quietly lean one way.

This does not need a giant conspiracy. You have a rule-set written in the same ideological language as NGOs, universities, and brand-safety frameworks. That tilts the Overton window by default.

So: Wikipedia, big subreddits, and Twitch are not neutral ground. They sit inside the same “safety / misinfo / ESG / DEI” ecosystem, and anything taken from them needs to be filtered with that in mind.

0.2 Three main pillars of the agenda

Underneath all the noise, the same incentive architecture runs three main agendas at the same time. This is a structural model inferred from how institutions behave, not a single written “master plan.”
	1.	Political censorship and narrative control
	•	The censorship / compliance stack: regulators, public broadcasters, NGOs, “disinfo” labs, fact-check cartels, TNI-style consortia, and brand-safety frameworks that punish deviation from approved narratives, especially on elections, Covid, gender, climate, and borders.
	2.	Foreign-aid and welfare spigot, plus bureaucratic bloat
	•	Trillions flow through programs and grants with huge surface area for waste, fraud, and patronage.
	•	Foreign aid is always sold as “only one percent of the budget,” but it still routes tens of billions through NGOs, multilaterals, and contractors.
	•	Domestic programs throw off hundreds of billions in “improper payments” and fraud every year. Oversight work puts reported improper payments at roughly 236 billion dollars in FY 2023 alone, and around 2.7 trillion dollars over the past two decades across programs like Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment insurance, SNAP and Covid-era relief. These are reported improper payments (a mix of fraud, abuse, ineligibility and admin error), but even if only a slice of that is outright fraud and patronage, the absolute number is huge.
	•	DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency), seeded with Elon Musk in a leading design and launch role, is explicitly aimed at cutting this spigot and is treated as an existential threat for that reason, even as Musk later shifted his primary focus back to his own companies and DOGE’s day-to-day work moved to other America First figures and career auditors.
	3.	Mass immigration, demographic engineering, and client-base lock-in
	•	Loosen borders, stretch asylum, and normalize large inflows, then layer amnesty and regularization on top.
	•	Build welfare and NGO ecosystems around newcomers, so entire sectors depend on permanent inflows and subsidies.
	•	Use speech laws, “hate” rules, and platform policing to contain backlash.
	•	In practice, the agenda only really cares about flows that are big and sustained enough to show up in census numbers and downstream electoral math. If migration is too small to move those numbers, it is background noise. This is about political incentives, not mind-reading any one leader.

The later sections track how Trump 2.0 and DOGE are hitting each pillar, and how the opposing bloc uses the same machine to resist.

1.	Not one cabal: an elite civil war inside one machine

There is not a single, unified world-brain running everything. What you have is:

1.1 Two main elite blocs
	1.	Davos / WEF / ESG / DEI bloc
	•	World Economic Forum, climate / net-zero frameworks, DEI, “stakeholder capitalism.”
	•	Big asset managers (BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street) historically pushing ESG and DEI through stewardship reports, proxy voting, and climate alliances (Net Zero Asset Managers, Climate Action 100+, etc.).
	•	Regulators, NGOs, universities, fact-check networks, and legacy media that mostly share this worldview.
	2.	Nationalist / “America First” / resource-capital bloc
	•	Trump 2.0 and people aligned with:
	•	Fossil fuels and heavy industry,
	•	National sovereignty over global governance,
	•	Tariff-backed trade renegotiation,
	•	Skepticism or hostility toward DEI/ESG and WEF-style global coordination.
	•	Red-state AGs, parts of the energy and defense sectors, and segments of conservative media.

They do clash. But both blocs still operate inside the same machine:
	•	U.S. dollar as core of global finance,
	•	U.S. courts and legal system,
	•	Bureaucracy and intel agencies,
	•	Legacy media and big tech platforms,
	•	Global supply chains.

The conflict is real but constrained. It is an internal fight inside the elite, not one faction living in a totally separate system.

1.2 Wall Street, offshoring, and the pre-Trump GOP

There is also a long-standing economic script that both parties ran before Trump, and a chunk of the Republican establishment still prefers it.
	•	For decades, the default setting was:
	•	Sign trade deals that make it easy for firms to shift production overseas.
	•	Treat “free trade” as a moral absolute instead of a tool.
	•	Let the financial sector reward any move that cuts domestic labor costs and boosts margins, even if it guts the industrial base.
	•	In practice, that meant:
	•	American companies invented and designed at home, then built factories and supply chains abroad and shipped goods back in.
	•	Wall Street pushed an asset-light model where plants, warehouses, and long-term workers are a liability, while contracts and IP are the “real” assets.
	•	Corporate management got paid to chase stock price and short-term returns, not to keep American production and skills alive.
	•	The old GOP fit neatly into this:
	•	They talked about patriotism while backing the same trade deals and cheap-labor policies that enriched global firms and hollowed out factory towns.
	•	They recycled Chamber of Commerce talking points on immigration, treating constant inflows and guest-worker programs as “pro-business,” with little regard for what it did to wages or community cohesion.

Trump’s economic line, and the Vance wing around him, is a break from that script:
	•	Tariffs, onshoring incentives, and tighter immigration rules are an attempt to flip the incentive structure so that closing a plant in Ohio and opening one in Guangdong is punished instead of rewarded.
	•	That puts the America First bloc not only against Davos and WEF, but also against the comfortable Wall Street model that treats the U.S. workforce as just another variable cost.
