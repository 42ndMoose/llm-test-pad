5.	Norms against purge politics.
	•	The “independent DOJ” norm and judicial culture make large-scale political purges very hard even when the targets arguably deserve consequences.

So even with Bondi and Trump:
	•	They cannot sign an order and have Comey, Brennan, Clapper, Mayorkas, and half of the censorship-industrial complex in cuffs by Monday.
	•	They have to build narrow, winnable cases or risk a string of courtroom losses that can be used forever as “proof there was nothing there.”

9.3 Congressional subpoenas vs actual criminal cases
	•	House committees can:
	•	Subpoena documents,
	•	Drag witnesses into hearings,
	•	Publish damning reports,
	•	Refer contempt or perjury.

But:
	•	Executive privilege, agency resistance, and court fights stretch timelines.
	•	Even slam-dunk findings still need DOJ to turn them into indictments.

That is why you see huge investigative output (reports, hearings, leaks) but relatively few high-level criminal convictions. Different branch, different tools.
