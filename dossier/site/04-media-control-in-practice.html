<pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;line-height:1.35">
To keep this grounded, you have to separate three levels:
	1.	Shareholders: Big Three, plus insiders (Murdochs, etc.).
	2.	Corporate management: CEOs, boards, news division bosses at Fox, Comcast, Disney, WBD, Sinclair.
	3.	On-air talent: hosts like Tucker Carlson, Jesse Watters, Maddow, etc.

4.1 What the Big Three actually do

The Big Three’s role is mostly:
	•	Voting on:
	•	Board composition,
	•	CEO pay,
	•	Major transactions and strategies.
	•	Issuing stewardship, ESG, and risk expectations:
	•	Climate and net-zero strategy,
	•	DEI and “human capital” norms,
	•	Governance practices.

They do not run day-to-day editorial:
	•	They are not in the control room deciding which Trump clip runs.
	•	They create incentives at board level:
	•	Avoid giant legal liabilities.
	•	Avoid regulatory shock.
	•	Stay broadly aligned, or at least not openly hostile, to prevailing ESG and governance frameworks, although that alignment is now contested inside the U.S.

4.2 Murdoch / Fox / Tucker example
	•	Fox Corp
	•	Controlled by the Murdoch family trust via dual-class shares.
	•	Big Three are sizeable but non-controlling shareholders.
	•	Tucker Carlson
	•	Became one of the most influential cable hosts in the U.S. by ratings and agenda-setting.
	•	Fox paid 787.5 million dollars to settle the Dominion Voting Systems defamation case.
	•	Tucker was also tied up in the Abby Grossberg lawsuit and broader internal HR and culture issues.

After that:
	•	Management (Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and Fox executives) fired Tucker.
	•	The Big Three were in the background as large investors who hate nine-figure settlements, but they were not writing his termination letter.

Takeaway:
	•	The decision to remove Tucker came from Fox management under legal and reputational pressure.
	•	The Big Three set the risk climate and own stock, but they did not pick the specific host to fire.

4.3 Why Jesse Watters and other pro-Trump hosts survive

Hosts like Jesse Watters are:
	•	Profitable, because they produce reliable ratings and ad revenue.
	•	Useful, because they keep the pro-Trump base on Fox instead of defecting to smaller competitors.
	•	Lower legal risk so far. They push the line but have not combined a Dominion-scale defamation event with simultaneous HR blow-ups.

As long as a host:
	•	Delivers ratings and revenue,
	•	Avoids catastrophic legal risk,
	•	Does not directly revolt against management,

they are an asset, not a liability.

From the Big Three perspective:
	•	They own chunks of pro-Trump media (Fox, Sinclair parent) and chunks of anti-Trump media (Comcast, Disney, WBD).
	•	The system above is diversified. There is conflict on air, and one big financial shell above it.
