2.	Nationalist / “America First” / resource-capital bloc
	•	Trump 2.0 and people aligned with:
	•	Fossil fuels and heavy industry,
	•	National sovereignty over global governance,
	•	Tariff-backed trade renegotiation,
	•	Skepticism or hostility toward DEI/ESG and WEF-style global coordination.
	•	Red-state AGs, parts of the energy and defense sectors, and segments of conservative media.

They do clash. But both blocs still operate inside the same machine:
	•	U.S. dollar as core of global finance,
	•	U.S. courts and legal system,
	•	Bureaucracy and intel agencies,
	•	Legacy media and big tech platforms,
	•	Global supply chains.

The conflict is real but constrained. It is an internal fight inside the elite, not one faction living in a totally separate system.

1.2 Wall Street, offshoring, and the pre-Trump GOP

There is also a long-standing economic script that both parties ran before Trump, and a chunk of the Republican establishment still prefers it.
	•	For decades, the default setting was:
	•	Sign trade deals that make it easy for firms to shift production overseas.
	•	Treat “free trade” as a moral absolute instead of a tool.
	•	Let the financial sector reward any move that cuts domestic labor costs and boosts margins, even if it guts the industrial base.
	•	In practice, that meant:
	•	American companies invented and designed at home, then built factories and supply chains abroad and shipped goods back in.
	•	Wall Street pushed an asset-light model where plants, warehouses, and long-term workers are a liability, while contracts and IP are the “real” assets.
	•	Corporate management got paid to chase stock price and short-term returns, not to keep American production and skills alive.
	•	The old GOP fit neatly into this:
	•	They talked about patriotism while backing the same trade deals and cheap-labor policies that enriched global firms and hollowed out factory towns.
	•	They recycled Chamber of Commerce talking points on immigration, treating constant inflows and guest-worker programs as “pro-business,” with little regard for what it did to wages or community cohesion.

Trump’s economic line, and the Vance wing around him, is a break from that script:
	•	Tariffs, onshoring incentives, and tighter immigration rules are an attempt to flip the incentive structure so that closing a plant in Ohio and opening one in Guangdong is punished instead of rewarded.
	•	That puts the America First bloc not only against Davos and WEF, but also against the comfortable Wall Street model that treats the U.S. workforce as just another variable cost.
