9.	Lawfare, prosecutions, and why accountability is slow

Now, specifically on Comey, Bondi, and why this is all so slow even with Trump back in power.

9.1 Bondi, DOJ, and Comey
	•	Pam Bondi is now Attorney General under Trump’s second term.
	•	Under prior administrations, DOJ repeatedly declined to charge James Comey despite harsh Inspector General findings on:
	•	His handling of Trump memos,
	•	FISA abuse around Crossfire Hurricane.
	•	Under Trump 2.0, Comey was finally indicted, but on narrower charges:
	•	False statements and obstruction linked to later testimony and handling of investigative actions, not a giant all-encompassing “Russiagate RICO.”

That fits the pattern:
	•	Instead of swinging for an unwieldy mega-conspiracy in front of a D.C. jury, Bondi’s DOJ targeted specific, recent, provable offences that survived statutes of limitation and venue constraints.
	•	Even then, motions practice and venue bias mattered. A D.C. judge ultimately dismissed the indictment on procedural and jurisdictional grounds before a jury could test the core allegations. Appeals and related investigative work can continue, but the headline result is that Comey walks for now.

This is textbook lawfare symmetry:
	•	The same legal culture that allowed aggressive, creative theories to be used against Trump and his allies for years suddenly becomes hyper-formalistic and cautious when the target is a former FBI Director who served the prior regime.

9.2 Why not mass prosecutions of “all the bad actors”?

Hard constraints:
