10.	Why Trump is still allowed to be amplified, and why he cannot just “break the chains”

Bringing it back to the lighter framing.

10.1 Why the system still “allows” Trump on air, uncut
	•	Elite split, not unity
	•	Davos / WEF / ESG bloc hates his disruption.
	•	Nationalist / resource-capital bloc likes tariffs, fossil expansion, defense spending, and reshoring.
	•	Big Three are soft power, not remote control
	•	They push themes at board level,
	•	But they do not line-edit every segment or cancel every populist.
	•	Profit motive
	•	Trump equals ratings equals money.
	•	Cable and digital outlets know that full speeches and live rallies keep audiences glued.

So:
	•	Parts of the elite want him gone or neutered.
	•	Other parts want to milk him, use him as leverage with China and the EU, or ride the fossil and defense boom he is enabling.
	•	The capital structure above them is hedged. It owns winners on both sides.

10.2 Why a Trump / Tulsi-style camp cannot fully “break the chains”

The “chains” are multiple overlapping systems:
	•	Global finance and the dollar system,
	•	Forums like WEF, IMF, and WTO and their networks,
	•	Administrative state and intel community,
	•	Judiciary and law enforcement,
	•	Corporate media and tech,
	•	NGO, university, and think-tank complex.

A presidency, even a two-term aggressive one, sits on top of:
	•	Hostile or mixed bureaucracy,
	•	Mixed or hostile courts,
	•	Divided Congress,
	•	Global markets that are ready to punish chaos or perceived instability.

If a president tried to smash the entire architecture at once, you would likely get:
	•	Liquid markets seizing up,
	•	Capital flight,
	•	Institutional sabotage and internal non-compliance,
	•	Some “legal” move to remove him (impeachment, Twenty-Fifth-style pretext, or lawfare to paralyze the administration).

So even a “rogue” president has to pick battles:
	•	Trump is hitting:
	•	DEI,
	•	ESG and net-zero coalitions,
	•	Climate regime,
	•	Trade and tariffs,
	•	Censorship cartels (via DOJ antitrust, congressional backing, and regulatory pressure).
	•	But he has not, and realistically cannot overnight:
	•	Break up every major media or tech conglomerate,
	•	End index-fund dominance,
	•	Replace the entire bureaucracy and judiciary with loyalists.

That is why:
	•	The fight is real. Elite factions are at war over direction.
	•	The machine mostly survives, and the public lives in the crossfire.
