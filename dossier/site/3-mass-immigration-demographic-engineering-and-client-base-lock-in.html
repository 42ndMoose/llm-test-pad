3.	Mass immigration, demographic engineering, and client-base lock-in
	•	Loosen borders, stretch asylum, and normalize large inflows, then layer amnesty and regularization on top.
	•	Build welfare and NGO ecosystems around newcomers, so entire sectors depend on permanent inflows and subsidies.
	•	Use speech laws, “hate” rules, and platform policing to contain backlash.
	•	In practice, the agenda only really cares about flows that are big and sustained enough to show up in census numbers and downstream electoral math. If migration is too small to move those numbers, it is background noise. This is about political incentives, not mind-reading any one leader.

The later sections track how Trump 2.0 and DOGE are hitting each pillar, and how the opposing bloc uses the same machine to resist.
