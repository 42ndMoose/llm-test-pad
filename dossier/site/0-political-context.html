0.	Political context

	•	Donald Trump is serving again as president of the United States as the 45th and 47th president, back in office since January 20, 2025.
	•	His second term is focused heavily on:
	•	Rolling back DEI inside the federal state and its contractor ecosystem (Executive Order 14151, Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing, plus follow-on orders).
	•	Hitting ESG and climate-linked finance alliances (big U.S. managers pulling out of Net Zero Asset Managers and Climate Action 100+ under legal and political heat).
	•	Supercharging fossil fuels (national “energy emergency” framing and orders to accelerate approvals for fossil projects).
	•	Using tariffs as leverage to rewire trade and supply chains (new Trump tariffs and threats on Canada, Mexico, China, EU, framed explicitly as a negotiation tool).
	•	Pushing back against the post-2016 “mis/disinformation” and censorship network (DOJ antitrust statement of interest against viewpoint collusion, House “censorship-industrial complex” reports, attacks on fact-check cartels).

The rest of this doc is about who actually holds power, how that power is structured, and what Trump is realistically doing inside that structure.

0.1 On sources, platforms, and bias

Before walking into the weeds, it matters where information comes from.

Wikipedia
	•	Formally aims for neutrality, but on hot topics (Covid, Trump, populism, “misinformation,” ESG, gender, etc.) editorial disputes and admin power tend to push toward legacy-media consensus. The source lists on those pages are usually heavy with the same large outlets and NGOs we are talking about later.
	•	You can still use it for dates, names, and basic scaffolding. Treat it as a map of consensus plus bias, not a final authority.

Reddit (big subs) and Twitch
	•	Large subs and Twitch communities are shaped by:
	•	Platform policies (“hate,” “misinfo,” “harassment,” etc.).
	•	Mod teams who know what those policies are and what gets them in trouble.
	•	Users who push against dominant narratives on elections, vaccines, gender, immigration, etc. are more likely to be:
	•	Banned outright,
	•	Stealth-suppressed via rules about “harm,” “hate,” or “misinfo,”
	•	Dogpiled while mods quietly lean one way.

This does not need a giant conspiracy. You have a rule-set written in the same ideological language as NGOs, universities, and brand-safety frameworks. That tilts the Overton window by default.

So: Wikipedia, big subreddits, and Twitch are not neutral ground. They sit inside the same “safety / misinfo / ESG / DEI” ecosystem, and anything taken from them needs to be filtered with that in mind.

0.2 Three main pillars of the agenda

Underneath all the noise, the same incentive architecture runs three main agendas at the same time. This is a structural model inferred from how institutions behave, not a single written “master plan.”
