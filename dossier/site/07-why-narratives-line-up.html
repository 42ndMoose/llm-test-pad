Why narratives line up without a single boss

You do not need a central puppet-master. The incentive structure does the work.

The stack:
	1.	Regulators
	•	Threat of fines, licence restrictions, or access-blocking if platforms and broadcasters “fail” on safety, harms, or misinfo (Ofcom, CRTC, FTC/DOJ, etc.).
	2.	NGO and academic hubs
	•	Provide the taxonomy, meaning what counts as misinfo, extremism, or “election interference.”
	•	Serve as routing hubs between agencies (CISA, State, DHS) and platforms (EIP, Virality Project, DFRLab, etc.).
	3.	Brand-safety frameworks
	•	Decide what is ad-safe or unsafe across entire categories (“hate,” “misinfo,” “harmful”), and steer billions in ad spend accordingly (GARM and successors).
	4.	Index-fund stewardship and WEF ideology
	•	Push boards toward ESG-aligned risk management.
	•	Normalize climate, DEI, and governance expectations as “best practice.”
	5.	Platform integrity systems
	•	Bake external norms into product policies:
	•	Labels,
	•	Fact-checks,
	•	Downranking,
	•	Bans and deplatforming.

Put together, they create a shared compliance regime:
	•	If you deviate too far, you risk:
	•	Regulator trouble,
	•	Loss of ad revenue,
	•	Investor pressure,
	•	NGO and media pile-ons.

So most executives steer roughly the same way, even if no one ever emails them an official “list of allowed sentences.”
