8.	Trump 2.0 vs that architecture

Trump’s second term is not just vibes. He is hitting specific pillars of this system.

8.1 DEI rollback

On day one, Trump signed Executive Order 14151 (Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing) and related orders that aim to terminate DEI-style programs inside the federal government and its contractor ecosystem.

Key points:
	•	Agencies are ordered to dismantle:
	•	DEI/DEIA offices,
	•	Equity-based strategic plans,
	•	DEI-based hiring and promotion criteria,
	•	DEI-linked grant and contract conditions.

Litigation status:
	•	Civil-rights and nonprofit plaintiffs sued to block the orders.
	•	A federal district court initially issued a nationwide preliminary injunction on parts of EO 14151, finding likely constitutional problems in how it was applied to speech and association.
	•	An appellate stay allowed key portions of the order to go back into effect while appeals proceed.

So the accurate line is:
	•	Courts are already blocking or modifying parts of Trump’s DEI rollback in specific contexts, not banning DEI as an abstract idea.

Practical effect:
	•	DEI inside the federal bureaucracy has stopped quietly expanding and is now a legal war zone, agency by agency and grant by grant.

8.2 Energy, climate, and global governance

Trump also signed energy-focused orders (including a national “energy emergency” framing) that:
	•	Declare insufficient domestic energy production a national emergency.
	•	Direct agencies to:
	•	Accelerate approvals for fossil-fuel projects,
	•	Repeal or weaken climate regulations,
	•	Reopen pipelines and drilling that were previously constrained,
	•	Undercut Paris-style international climate commitments and net-zero timetables.

From the WEF and UN climate crowd’s perspective, this is a direct attack on:
	•	Net-zero alliances,
	•	Coordinated phase-outs of fossil fuels,
	•	The entire “finance as climate enforcer” model.

8.3 Tariffs and trade leverage

Trump is using tariffs as a blunt instrument and a negotiating lever:
	•	New or threatened tariffs on Mexico and Canada tied to border, fentanyl, and security conditions.
	•	Maintenance and possible expansion of tariffs on Chinese and EU goods.
	•	Explicit framing that firms can:
	•	Build in the U.S. and enjoy low tax, or
	•	Build abroad and pay tariffs so “America profits either way.”

This approach treats global supply chains like a high-friction toll road instead of a free highway. It is also a direct shot at the old Wall Street consensus that treated offshoring as a one-way upgrade and expected Washington to protect the financial system while the real economy was hollowed out.

8.4 Trump vs WEF on WEF’s own stage

Trump is not boycotting Davos. He is using it as hostile terrain:
	•	Shows up, or beams in, to tell CEOs:
	•	America is open for business,
	•	Tariffs will punish offshoring,
	•	Fossil fuels are back,
	•	DEI and ESG should not be mandated through federal policy.

Meanwhile, WEF leadership (now including Fink) is still selling:
	•	Net-zero,
	•	DEI,
	•	Stakeholder capitalism,
	•	Global public-private governance.

That is open ideological conflict inside a shared elite venue.

8.5 DOGE, foreign aid, and the money spigot

There is a reason the response to DOGE and Musk is so hysterical. They do not just tweet, they threaten the cash-flow layer that keeps the machine bought in.

8.5.1 Scale of the money
Foreign aid
	•	U.S. foreign assistance sits in the range of tens of billions of dollars a year, often described as around one percent of the federal budget, but that is still a massive pot of money.
	•	A big share moves through:
	•	Large NGOs,
	•	Beltway consulting and contracting firms,
	•	UN agencies and development banks,
	•	Local partners where oversight is weak or political.

Domestic programs and improper payments
	•	Federal reports put total reported improper payments at roughly 236 billion dollars in a recent year alone, and about 2.7 trillion dollars since the mid-2000s across dozens of federal programs.
	•	Programs like SNAP, Medicaid, Medicare, unemployment insurance, disability, and Covid-era emergency schemes are recurring sources of fraud, identity theft, card skimming, trafficking, and simple bureaucratic error.

The point is not that every dollar is corrupt. The point is that the scale is so large that even “small” failure rates mean hundreds of billions of grey-zone money sloshing around every year.

8.5.2 DOGE’s mandate, Musk’s role, and the backlash
	•	DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) was set up in Trump’s second term as a dedicated efficiency arm. Musk had a leading role in its design and initial launch phase, with other America First figures deeply involved in the early structure.
	•	Its public mission is to use executive-branch power to claw back trillions over a decade by:
	•	Tightening program integrity and eligibility,
	•	Cutting deadweight bureaucracy,
	•	Reviewing foreign-aid flows,
	•	Closing obvious fraud channels in big social programs.
	•	Over time, Musk shifted his main attention back to Tesla, SpaceX, X and his other companies, with DOGE’s day-to-day operations and audits increasingly handled by a mix of aligned political appointees and career inspectors. The architecture he helped design, however, continues to target the same cash flows.

The response from the establishment looks like this:
	•	Musk is routinely portrayed with fascist or authoritarian imagery in protests and hostile coverage. “Musk as danger to democracy” becomes a standard meme in activist campaigns that target Tesla, X and DOGE-adjacent reforms at the same time.
	•	Progressive outlets frame DOGE as authoritarian or even illegal, on the theory that deep cuts in certain programs are inherently anti-democratic.
	•	Independent digging keeps turning up the same pattern: many of the groups that organize against DOGE and related cuts are tied into the same NGO and grant ecosystem that benefits from the spending under review, even if the paperwork is messy and indirect.

The same rhetoric that paints Musk as a threat to democracy is part of the broader habit of marking certain figures as illegitimate or dangerous, which shows up more starkly in the violence cases later in the doc.

DOGE is hitting the bureaucratic money layer in a similar way as the TNI antitrust move hits the narrative layer. In both cases, the message is that coordinated cartels are real and can be treated as such. Even if the DOGE brand is trimmed, renamed, or quietly folded into dull budget offices in some future shuffle, the exposed math on fraud and improper payments does not vanish.

8.5.3 Foreign aid as a protected story
Foreign aid is constantly marketed as:
	•	“only one percent of the budget,”
	•	morally untouchable,
	•	proof of enlightened global leadership.

At the same time:
	•	When DOGE or Trump pause or re-tier aid, you get instant backlash about the “rules-based order” and horror stories about collapsed programs, but almost no interest from legacy media in:
	•	audit trails,
	•	fraud detection,
	•	contractor enrichment,
	•	political kickback structures.

So agenda 2 is simple. Keep the money flowing with minimal honest scrutiny, and treat anyone who wants to shut the tap as borderline fascist.

8.6 Immigration, amnesty, and demographic lock-in

The third agenda sits upstream from elections: change who lives in the country, who can vote, and who is structurally dependent on the state and NGOs.

8.6.1 The Obama to Biden arc
Obama era groundwork
	•	The “deporter in chief” label rested heavily on counting changes. Fast border removals were counted as formal removals, which pumped the numbers without a serious interior crackdown.
	•	At the same time, his administration:
	•	Created DACA in 2012, which gave lawful presence and work authorization to hundreds of thousands who entered as minors.
	•	Pushed DAPA in 2014, which would have covered millions of parents of citizens and green-card holders if courts had not blocked it.
	•	Backed the 2013 “Gang of Eight” bill, which mixed legal status and a pathway to citizenship for the existing unauthorized population with major expansions in future legal migration and guest-worker flows.

Biden era surge
	•	Under Biden, the unauthorized population jumped by several million in just a few years, driven by:
	•	Record border encounters,
	•	Large numbers released into the interior with pending asylum or parole,
	•	Very weak interior enforcement for many categories.

This is a pattern. One administration builds legal scaffolding and normalizes the idea of mass regularization. The next administration presides over very large inflows that can later be legalized and counted in census and districting numbers.

8.6.2 Europe as a future-state demo
EU and Schengen
	•	EU asylum numbers climbed back to levels comparable to the 2015 crisis.
	•	Even when irregular crossings dip briefly, the stock of people inside the bloc keeps growing because outflows and removals are low.

UK: hotels, digital ID, and speech-crime policing
	•	The UK has spent billions of pounds housing asylum seekers in hotels for years, with long-term contracts and giant windfalls for contractors.
	•	In parallel, it has:
	•	Brought in the Online Safety Act,
	•	Expanded digital ID infrastructure,
	•	Kept communication offences on the books that result in thousands of arrests per year for posts deemed “grossly offensive” or “harassing.”

You end up with a two-tier pattern: weak capacity or will to remove violent offenders and illegal entrants, combined with very efficient policing of angry tweets about Islam, migration, and crime.

8.6.3 Canada catching up
	•	Canada is now copying core pieces of that model:
	•	Federal and provincial money paying for hotels and shelters for asylum claimants and irregular arrivals,
	•	Billions in interim housing and “temporary” programs that quietly become structural,
	•	Overlapping benefits and rebates that are easy to game when ID and residency checks are weak.

In a high-immigration, low-housing-supply environment, this turns into a fight over who the welfare state is really for, and which voter groups parties are trying hardest to lock in.

8.6.4 How this feeds one-party and “fake opposition” dynamics
The immigration pillar connects to the one-party and fake-opposition idea like this:
	•	Import large numbers first, regularize and count later.
	•	Build NGOs, social services, and contractor empires around those flows, so there is a permanent lobby for high inflows and generous benefits.
	•	Define criticism of this setup as “hate,” “disinformation,” or “extreme right,” and treat serious crackdown proposals as proof of fascist intent.

That is exactly where Kier Starmer, Mark Carney, and similar Davos-friendly leaders sit: they talk “tough” at the margins but keep the basic model intact. Meanwhile, real nationalist opposition is treated as radioactive, and “conservatives in name only” manage the same system with different branding.

Trump’s second term is one of the few places where all three pillars are under attack at the same time:
	•	Pillar 1: censorship stack, through DOJ antitrust in TNI, congressional exposure of EIP/DFRLab and GARM, and pressure on platforms.
	•	Pillar 2: the money spigot, through DOGE, foreign-aid reviews, and program-integrity drives in social spending.
	•	Pillar 3: immigration, through enforcement, asylum restriction, and resistance to new mass-amnesty plays.

8.7 Education, abuse scandals, and why some want the federal department gone

The same people who worry about censorship and demographic engineering also point at education.
	•	Test scores and basic literacy trends are the surface story. Critics say the federal Department of Education adds layers of bureaucracy and ideology while schools fail on reading, math, and discipline.
	•	Underneath that, there is a darker concern:
	•	Abuse and grooming scandals in schools, youth programs, and some residential settings are often handled through internal procedures, PR, and ideology instead of straightforward criminal accountability.
	•	Federal guidance on gender identity, discipline, and “restorative” justice has sometimes been used as cover to downplay serious offences or to discourage clear reporting.

In that frame, the complaint is not that the Department of Education literally runs trafficking rings. The complaint is that a mix of centralized rules, ideological filters, and weak accountability creates an environment where predators can hide behind policy and where whistleblowers or angry parents are easier to label as “hateful” or “extreme” than to engage seriously.

So when Trump world talks about tearing down or radically shrinking the federal Department of Education, it is not only about test scores. It is also about:
	•	Pulling control back to states and parents,
	•	Breaking the pipeline where TNI-style narratives and federal guidance shape what schools teach about borders, sex, race, and policing,
	•	Closing loopholes that make it easier for bad actors to operate inside large systems with little sunlight.

That connects education to all three pillars: narrative control in the classroom, welfare and grant money in the education industry, and long-term shaping of the electorate.

8.8 Delegitimization, “dangerous rhetoric,” and real-world attacks

The same ecosystem that talks endlessly about “dangerous rhetoric” from the right also runs its own delegitimizing script against Trump, ICE, the National Guard, and conservative figures. The pattern matters because it lines up with real violence.

8.8.1 Delegitimizing Trump’s orders and the “seditious six”
Inside the Davos / TNI-aligned bloc, a group of Democrat lawmakers often described as the “seditious six” have pushed a line that:
	•	Trump’s orders to federal agencies, Guard units, and other security forces are presumptively “illegal” or “unconstitutional,” and
	•	Members of the armed forces and law enforcement are morally allowed, even obliged, to disobey them.

By itself, reminding troops that they must refuse unlawful orders is uncontroversial. What changes the meaning is the surrounding narrative:
	•	The same information ecosystem has spent years branding Trump as a would-be dictator, a “new Hitler,” or an existential threat to democracy.
	•	Every major security action he takes is framed as a dry run for authoritarian rule.
	•	Guard deployments, ICE enforcement, or border crackdowns are described as if they are already war crimes that decent people must resist.

In that context, messages from the “seditious six” are not neutral civics lessons. They function as elite permission: if you sabotage, defy, or even attack Trump-aligned institutions, you are not a criminal, you are “resisting fascism.”

8.8.2 ICE officers and a thousand-percent spike in threats
ICE is the clearest case.
	•	After years of “Abolish ICE” campaigns, Nazi and Gestapo comparisons, and constant claims that basic immigration enforcement is inherently racist, threats and attacks on ICE officers spiked by around 1,000 percent compared with prior baselines.
	•	These officers are not freelance militias. They are carrying out enforcement under statutes passed by Congress and orders that fall within long-standing executive power.

The message from the TNI / NGO / media bloc is:
	•	On paper: violence is wrong.
	•	In practice: ICE is treated as a uniquely evil agency that good people should ostracize, and anyone who blocks ICE in the field is romanticized as part of a “sanctuary” movement.

So the same people who constantly warn that harsh words about journalists or judges can create “stochastic terrorism” shrug off a thousand-percent jump in threats against ICE as background noise.

8.8.3 National Guard shooting near the White House
The logic does not stop at ICE. It now reaches the National Guard.
	•	In late 2025, two West Virginia National Guardsmen on duty near the White House were shot in the face by a 29-year-old Afghan illegal immigrant, Rahmanullah Lakanwal.
	•	One of the Guardsmen has been publicly identified as Andrew Wolfe. Initial reports described both victims as gravely wounded, with subsequent accounts reporting at least one fatality.

Even if you set aside motive in this single case, the environment is clear:
	•	For months, Trump’s use of Guard units has been described by TNI-adjacent outlets and hostile lawmakers as “illegal,” “authoritarian,” or a “paramilitary” move.
	•	The same “seditious six” framing tells soldiers and Guard members they should treat Trump’s commands as suspect or unlawful.
	•	Guard units protecting federal sites or backing local law enforcement are painted as tools of a rogue regime, not as ordinary citizen-soldiers doing a constitutional job.

Once that framing is normalized, an attack on uniformed Guard members near the White House does not land in a vacuum. It lands in a culture that already treats those uniforms as symbols of “illegitimate” power.

8.8.4 Charlie Kirk’s assassination
The assassination of Charlie Kirk fits the same pattern on the media side.
	•	For years, Kirk was branded across TNI-aligned outlets and activist networks as a far-right extremist, a “radicalizer,” and part of a supposed pipeline to fascism.
	•	The charge was not that he ran terror cells, but that his speech itself was too dangerous to tolerate.

When he was assassinated, the reaction from that ecosystem followed a familiar script:
	•	Downplay any political motive as the act of a lone disturbed person.
	•	Avoid asking whether years of dehumanizing rhetoric against “MAGA influencers” helped create an atmosphere where targeting him looked noble to the attacker.
	•	Push the story back into the usual narrative: right-wing speech is dangerous, right-wing victims are collateral, and the real threat is still “extremism” from the same side that just lost someone.

Again, the point for this doc is not to psychoanalyze the killer. The point is the asymmetry:
	•	When a deranged person with a loose link to the right hurts someone, legacy media shout about “stochastic terrorism” and “incitement.”
	•	When someone kills or attacks a conservative figure who has been smeared as a danger to democracy, the same people insist rhetoric had nothing to do with it.

8.8.5 Attempted assassination of Trump and how the story is laundered
The attempted assassination of Trump himself fits the same script, just turned up another notch.
	•	At a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, a young gunman opened fire from an elevated position, nearly killing Trump, killing firefighter Corey Comperatore as he shielded his family, and seriously wounding other supporters.
	•	Official language from security agencies classifies it correctly as an assassination attempt, but public briefings lean hard on “investigation ongoing,” “motive unclear,” and the shooter’s personal instability.

There are a few awkward facts for the narrative machine:
	•	The shooter’s political footprint is muddled on purpose in coverage. Small-dollar donations routed through Democrat-aligned infrastructure sit next to later registration data that can be waved around to say “actually he was a Republican,” letting outlets claim there is “no clear political motive.”
	•	Evidence of preparation (research into past assassinations, ballistics, routes, and the layout of the venue) makes it hard to sell this as a pure impulse snap.

So the way the story is told ends up like this:
	•	Lead with mental health and “lone wolf.”
	•	Treat the political and media climate as off-limits.
	•	Focus on technical security failures at the Secret Service as if the only question is whether the rooftop should have been locked down faster.

What gets pushed out of frame is the years of messaging that said:
	•	Trump is an existential threat to democracy,
	•	his return to office would be the end of the republic,
	•	stopping him is a moral emergency.

If you repeat that enough times in respectable venues, you do not have to hand a shooter a written order. You just need one unstable person to conclude that taking a shot is heroic. The same outlets that insists Trump’s insults create “stochastic terrorism” against journalists suddenly act as if their own drumbeat about “fascism” and “democracy’s last stand” could not possibly shape anyone’s behavior.

The treatment of the Butler attack lines up perfectly with the earlier pattern: when violence can be pinned on the right, speech and “climate” are blamed; when violence hits Trump or his supporters, the climate is declared irrelevant and the story is reduced to security protocols and a troubled mind.

8.8.6 What “dangerous rhetoric” really looks like in this model
Put the pieces together:
	•	Delegitimization from the top
	•	Trump is framed as an illegitimate president and budding dictator.
	•	His orders to ICE, Border Patrol, and the Guard are described as unlawful by default.
	•	Permission language from lawmakers
	•	The “seditious six” tell soldiers and officers that they may disobey Trump’s “illegal” commands, in an environment where hostile media treat almost every command that way.
	•	Demonization of specific targets
	•	ICE is painted as a quasi-criminal organization, and threats against ICE officers jump by around a thousand percent.
	•	National Guard units are portrayed as regime enforcers.
	•	Media figures like Charlie Kirk are labeled as dangerous radicals.
	•	Trump himself is treated as a uniquely evil figure whose removal is a moral duty.
	•	Violence that lines up with the narrative
	•	ICE officers see massive increases in threats and harassment.
	•	National Guardsmen are shot in the face near the White House by an illegal Afghan migrant.
	•	A high-profile conservative activist is assassinated after being smeared as a danger to democracy.
	•	The sitting president survives an assassination attempt at a rally, while the same media class that spent years calling him a fascist treats the political climate as an unrelated side issue.

The same networks that lecture about “dangerous rhetoric” when Trump insults CNN or calls out a judge are seeding something far more corrosive:
	•	They undermine the basic legitimacy of constitutional orders when Trump gives them.
	•	They signal that some uniforms (ICE, Guard) and some voices (Kirk, Musk, Trump and anyone in his orbit) are fair game in a moral war.
	•	Then they wash their hands when that climate produces exactly the sort of attacks they claim to fear.

In the three-pillar model, this fits squarely inside Pillar 1 (political censorship and narrative control):
	•	It is not only about what you are allowed to say online.
	•	It is about which institutions and people are framed as lawful and which ones are turned into villains that “good people” can sabotage, shame, or attack.
