2.	Foreign-aid and welfare spigot, plus bureaucratic bloat
	•	Trillions flow through programs and grants with huge surface area for waste, fraud, and patronage.
	•	Foreign aid is always sold as “only one percent of the budget,” but it still routes tens of billions through NGOs, multilaterals, and contractors.
	•	Domestic programs throw off hundreds of billions in “improper payments” and fraud every year. Oversight work puts reported improper payments at roughly 236 billion dollars in FY 2023 alone, and around 2.7 trillion dollars over the past two decades across programs like Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment insurance, SNAP and Covid-era relief. These are reported improper payments (a mix of fraud, abuse, ineligibility and admin error), but even if only a slice of that is outright fraud and patronage, the absolute number is huge.
	•	DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency), seeded with Elon Musk in a leading design and launch role, is explicitly aimed at cutting this spigot and is treated as an existential threat for that reason, even as Musk later shifted his primary focus back to his own companies and DOGE’s day-to-day work moved to other America First figures and career auditors.
