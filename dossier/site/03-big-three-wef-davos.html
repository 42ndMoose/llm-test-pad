<h1>3. Big Three + WEF / Davos</h1>
<pre style="white-space:pre-wrap;line-height:1.35">
3.	Big Three + WEF / Davos

The same Big Three that sit on media cap tables also plug into Davos-style governance.

3.1 BlackRock
	•	BlackRock is a World Economic Forum partner and has been part of WEF events and initiatives for years.
	•	Larry Fink (BlackRock’s CEO) now serves as interim co-chair of the WEF Board of Trustees.

3.2 State Street
	•	State Street openly brands itself as a WEF partner and highlights its role at Davos.

3.3 Vanguard
	•	Vanguard became a founding member of the WEF-linked Global Parity Alliance, a DEI-focused initiative on “parity” and inclusion.

Combine that with climate alliances:
	•	Vanguard publicly announced its withdrawal from the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative in 2022.
	•	Climate Action 100+ later confirmed that JPMorgan Asset Management and State Street Global Advisors left the coalition, while BlackRock shifted participation to a non-U.S. arm.

So even after recent retreats under U.S. antitrust and political pressure, the picture is:
	•	Big Three hold major equity stakes in media, energy, tech, and most of corporate America.
	•	BlackRock and State Street are WEF partners.
	•	Vanguard has been pulled into WEF’s DEI apparatus via the Global Parity Alliance.
	•	Fink literally helps run WEF’s board.

That is a documented link between the asset-management layer and the WEF governance layer.

3.4 Mark Carney: ESG-aligned PM in the same orbit

On the Canadian side, you now have Mark Carney as a political expression of that same climate / ESG ecosystem:
	•	Carney is Prime Minister of Canada and Leader of the Liberal Party, taking over from Justin Trudeau in March 2025 and then winning a federal election that left the Liberals just short of a majority.
	•	Before that he was:
	•	Governor of the Bank of Canada, then Governor of the Bank of England,
	•	The UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance,
	•	Vice-chair at Brookfield Asset Management, responsible for “impact” and ESG-branded investment strategies.

Those roles drop him straight into the global climate-finance and ESG architecture: UN climate machinery, big asset managers, and WEF-style public-private governance.

So even though his government has made tactical moves like killing the consumer carbon tax while keeping a rebate-style transfer in place, his background and network are firmly in the ESG / Davos camp. In the frame of this doc, Carney is Canada’s ESG-aligned PM inside the Liberal machine, interacting with the same global elite architecture that Trump is fighting from the other side.
