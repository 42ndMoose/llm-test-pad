9.	Lawfare, prosecutions, and why accountability is slow

Now, specifically on Comey, Bondi, and why this is all so slow even with Trump back in power.

9.1 Bondi, DOJ, and Comey
	•	Pam Bondi is now Attorney General under Trump’s second term.
	•	Under prior administrations, DOJ repeatedly declined to charge James Comey despite harsh Inspector General findings on:
	•	His handling of Trump memos,
	•	FISA abuse around Crossfire Hurricane.
	•	Under Trump 2.0, Comey was finally indicted, but on narrower charges:
	•	False statements and obstruction linked to later testimony and handling of investigative actions, not a giant all-encompassing “Russiagate RICO.”

That fits the pattern:
	•	Instead of swinging for an unwieldy mega-conspiracy in front of a D.C. jury, Bondi’s DOJ targeted specific, recent, provable offences that survived statutes of limitation and venue constraints.
	•	Even then, motions practice and venue bias mattered. A D.C. judge ultimately dismissed the indictment on procedural and jurisdictional grounds before a jury could test the core allegations. Appeals and related investigative work can continue, but the headline result is that Comey walks for now.

This is textbook lawfare symmetry:
	•	The same legal culture that allowed aggressive, creative theories to be used against Trump and his allies for years suddenly becomes hyper-formalistic and cautious when the target is a former FBI Director who served the prior regime.

9.2 Why not mass prosecutions of “all the bad actors”?

Hard constraints:
	1.	Criminal law is not the same as moral outrage.
	•	Being corrupt, biased, or a regime propagandist is not automatically a crime.
	•	You still need clean statutory hooks: perjury, obstruction, bribery, fraud, and so on.
	2.	Statutes of limitation.
	•	Many of the ugliest episodes (early Crossfire Hurricane, first-wave Covid censorship, 2020 “fortification”) are now several years back.
	•	If the clock runs out, you are finished before you start.
	3.	Venue and juries.
	•	Big federal cases land in D.C. and other blue venues.
	•	Durham already showed what that looks like: brutal report on FBI behavior, but almost no serious convictions and high-profile acquittals. Juries there are sympathetic to the same institutions you are trying to put on trial.
	4.	DOJ bureaucracy.
	•	Career prosecutors and agents were not swapped out overnight in 2025.
	•	They can slow-walk, undermine, or simply decline to bring cases they see as risky or “politicized.”
	5.	Norms against purge politics.
	•	The “independent DOJ” norm and judicial culture make large-scale political purges very hard even when the targets arguably deserve consequences.

So even with Bondi and Trump:
	•	They cannot sign an order and have Comey, Brennan, Clapper, Mayorkas, and half of the censorship-industrial complex in cuffs by Monday.
	•	They have to build narrow, winnable cases or risk a string of courtroom losses that can be used forever as “proof there was nothing there.”

9.3 Congressional subpoenas vs actual criminal cases
	•	House committees can:
	•	Subpoena documents,
	•	Drag witnesses into hearings,
	•	Publish damning reports,
	•	Refer contempt or perjury.

But:
	•	Executive privilege, agency resistance, and court fights stretch timelines.
	•	Even slam-dunk findings still need DOJ to turn them into indictments.

That is why you see huge investigative output (reports, hearings, leaks) but relatively few high-level criminal convictions. Different branch, different tools.
