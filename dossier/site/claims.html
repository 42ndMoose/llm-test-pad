Evidence:
- Research reference (academic): “The Hidden Power of the Big Three? Passive index funds, re-concentration of corporate ownership, and new financial risk” (Fichtner / Heemskerk / Garcia-Bernardo). (Add your preferred canonical link; avoid SSRN mirrors if they keep disappearing.)</td><td style='white-space:nowrap'><a href="./02-ownership-layer.html">2.

<tr><td style='white-space:nowrap'>C-02-ownership-layer-002</td><td>Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street frequently show up as top institutional holders across many large-cap issuers because broad index funds and related mandates force them to own “the market” in size.
Verification paths:
- SEC EDGAR 13F-HR filings (Vanguard / BlackRock entities / State Street entities)
- Proxy statements (DEF 14A) for issuer-side “beneficial owners” tables (often lists Vanguard/BlackRock when &gt;5%)</td><td style='white-space:nowrap'><a href="./02-ownership-layer.html">2.

<tr><td style='white-space:nowrap'>C-02-ownership-layer-003</td><td>Comcast’s proxy filings typically list large institutional holders (often including Vanguard and BlackRock) in the “beneficial ownership” section when they exceed reporting thresholds.
Evidence (primary):
- Comcast DEF 14A filing index (example): https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1166691/000119312521080275/0001193125-21-080275-index.html
Notes:
- If you want “top holders including State Street even below 5%,” pair the proxy with 13F (holder-side) checks.</td><td style='white-space:nowrap'><a href="./02-ownership-layer.html">2.

<tr><td style='white-space:nowrap'>C-02-ownership-layer-005</td><td>On many large issuers, Vanguard + BlackRock + State Street can add up to a double-digit economic stake when you total their reported positions.
Evidence (how to verify cleanly):
- Use SEC 13F filings for each manager entity and sum positions for the issuer’s CUSIP
- Or use a reputable ownership table, then capture the math in your own note (screenshot + date)</td><td style='white-space:nowrap'><a href="./02-ownership-layer.html">2. Ownership layer: Big Three and legacy media</a> <span style='opacity:.7'>(line 172)</span></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td style='white-space:nowrap'>C-02-ownership-layer-006</td><td>Warner Bros. Discovery filings can be verified the same way: issuer proxy (DEF 14A) for beneficial owners, then 13F checks for the “full institutional stack.”

- WBD DEF 14A (example mirror; replace with your preferred SEC index if you want zero third-party reliance):
  - EDGAR-online mirror: https://content.edgar-online.com/ExternalLink/EDGAR/0001437107-24-000102.html?dest=wbd-20240419_htm&amp;hash=41fd5a78752d62e5c8afa7b2724a4b3707fe1da4aa962bec17ae10fece022095
