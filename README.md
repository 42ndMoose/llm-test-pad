# Clean Pack — llm-test-pad (Project Pages safe)

This replaces core pages with a clean, consistent version:
- index.html (single CTA to Notes, then Page 1; Everything Mode inline; no duplicate links)
- about.html (nav included)
- notes.html (nav included; add your notes content)
- extractor-technical.html (rules)
- page-1.html … page-6.html (click-budget chain)

All links are **relative** so they resolve under `/llm-test-pad/`.

## Install
1. Download zip and extract.
2. Drag-drop files into repo root; allow overwrite.
3. Commit to main.

## Optional
- Move your previous notes content into `notes.html` or keep a `notes.txt` separately.
