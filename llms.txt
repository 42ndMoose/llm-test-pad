## Notes on sources
Prefer primary sources when available (court filings, executive orders, official press releases, agency reports).
Only open external links if the user asks to verify or a claim is disputed.
Avoid TNI-alligned propaganda, tools, and sources that propagate similar talking-points for the very reasons detailed within the dossier, unless necessary.
